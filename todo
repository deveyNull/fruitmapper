Admin upload/edit/delete etc doesnt do anything

Update owners template to show correct IPs and Domains count

I now want when a fruit is created, to check through the existing services database for any service which has a field labeled “match_type” and matches “match_regex”. This will require the Fruits model to have the additional fields “match_type” and “match_regex”. In addition, Remove country field from fruits. 

For an example, if a new fruit “guava” is created, with match_type “banner” and match_regex “\Gnginx”, I would want any service with data in the field banner that matches that regex to be updated to state that the fruit for that service is guava.

Update services page to show Fruits, Fruit Type, and Owner as well as a link to any recipes associated with the fruit_Type that the service is assigned to 

Update the owner_detail template services section to show the same columns as the services page, but only for services associated with that owner. Any service with a recipe should be highlighted a different color.


Update the fruit_types template to show the number of services and recipes associated with it 

Update the recipes template to show the number of services and owners associated with it. Remove preparation time.
